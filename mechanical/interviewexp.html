  <p class =  "text-justify">My interviewer asked me mostly the basics of IC engine (very important), mechanics, design, manufacturing, thermo, engg. drawing. They may ask from your favourite topics as well (mine was design, so most questions revolved around it). Overall interview experience: They check your confidence and communication skills. Internship and project work matter significantly. We had to give a presentation over our best two projects/ internship and two biggest achievements (I included projects and internships in that too) pertaining to the department we are interested in (engg. design and quality control, production, sales, managent, etc). This presentation is where you can make a significant impact on interviewers and impress them with good presentation skills, confidence,
  communication skills. Show your quality work and what you learnt from that (like leadership skills, teamwork, management, etc).  </p>

  <p class = "quoteline"><span>Akshay Dahiya</span>Batch of 2017 @PhD at Virginia Tech</p><div class = "text-justify">
  <p class=  "text-justify">Let me first write about how I got the opportunity to do a fully paid research intern in United States without having a 9+ GPA. The idea is to develop a good research profile by doing a research intern in 2nd year and making academic contacts. Once you have a nice senior-reviewed resume, just email day-in and day-out. I was lucky to get a decently paid internship (8k/month) in IIT Kanpur in my 2nd year. The experience was great. I worked on a challenging and futuristic research project which helped me build my research profile. I was a 8 pointer around my 3rd year and MITACS was my only hope, as other foreign internship programs like SN Bose (US), DAAD (Germany), etc. require a 9+ GPA. But I didn't get through mitacs.<span id="dots">...</span></p>
  <p id="more" class = "text-justify">Then an unexpected opportunity fall into my lap just because of research Intern in 2nd year. My advisor from IITK had done his Ph.D. from Virginia Tech, US and he asked me if I would be interested to work with his Ph.D. advisor at Blacksburg, US. This was all a product of my research profile and having a strong recommendation from my IITK professor. I was paid a monthly stipend while in Blacksburg for Summer 2016 through which I could cover my travel and accommodation completely. With some saving, I traveled a few cities around the US too (Columbus, Washington DC, New York, clearly showing off here but it was a great deal for me back then). It was a wonderful experience traveling alone to the US.
  </br></br>Coming to my research, it was about modelling and simulation of helical carbon nanotubes using molecular mechanics. My research experiences during summer 2015 at IITK and during summer 2016 at Virginia Tech really shaped my future as a researcher and I keenly joined as a Ph.D. student after finishing my bachelors degree in 2017. The research environment and the facilities I found in the US is not there in India. Having worked on a Capstone project at TimeTooth Technologies, Noida (a research based start-up) in my final semester (I got Honors degree where we finished coursework in 7 semesters), I really enjoy the freedom as a Ph.D. student. I think research is cool and everyone in their 2nd year should give it a try. It really helps to build a good CV even for job interviews later. If you enjoy research well and good, then you have a better chance to get a foreign intern in 3rd year. If you don't like it, you can always switch to a industrial intern or management intern in 3rd year. Good luck!
  </br></br>Oh damn! I just realized the question was about "interview experience" not "internship experience". I had my interview in Delhi in Feb 2016, when Dr. Batra, my prospective advisor from Virginia Tech was visiting India. I prepared a power-point presentation about my research project at IITK. I presented it face-to-face and he happened to like it. Later I sent him my CV too but he had no questions about my CV or courses. So all-in-all I got this opportunity because of my research interests as they aligned with Dr. Batra's research. For research internships, your interviews revolve around your research area and your experience in that field of research.

  <p class =  "text-justify">There was a discussion with the professor whom I mailed for the internship, no formal interview as such. I told him about my past projects/internships and how our interests and my projects coincide. He told me about the project I will be working on. This was basically to verify that I am genuinely interested and competent.  </p>
